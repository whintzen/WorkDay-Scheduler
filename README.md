## Instructions

To view the [Deployed](https://whintzen.github.io/WorkDay-Scheduler/index.html) App, you can clicked on `Deployed` which will open the App in Github.   Once the WorkDay-Scheduler app is rendered in the browser, enter your workday schedule into the timeslot text area and click on the `save` button.  Please note, if you open the browser after 9 AM, any time slots prior to your current time will be `greyed` out.  Current time will be `blue` and future time will be `purple`.   Once you have saved a work schedule, `right` click and open the `inspect`.  On the menu option, go to `Application` and `Local Storage` and the entries you have saved is displayed in Local Storage.
